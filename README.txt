 2015 A.D. Introductory Information
=================================

2015 A.D. (pronounced "2015 ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
real-time strategy game of the apocalypse.

This is currently an incomplete, under-development version of the game.
I am always interested in getting more people involved, to help bring the game
towards completion and to share the interesting experience of developing a
project of this scope.
